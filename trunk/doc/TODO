bugs:
 - exception handler doesn't always lead to clean termination
 - bad access usermask causes exception

improvements:
 - ordering for multi-part factoids

 - access "none" to delete user access entries

 - make "find" accept an RM specifier (83/95/05), defaulting to current (95 right now)

 - quote with regex

 - switch to stream_text_io

 - nickserv GHOST command, and nick change

 - factoid => reply/action

 - make user auth cache a variable-size array, not a linked list

 - stylesheet for docs

 x nick collisions and other stateful jobs (ping -> "periodic" task?  other error returns?)

 x handle freenode version query (start by adding Identity package)

 x actions

 x "last" command

 x message about how to get an access level

 x ensure all quotes short enough to be transmitted in one go (max is 446, btw)

 x access <user>

 x per-command help messages, command access levels

stats improvements:
 x   ident line
 x   count of known quotes
 x   individual command usage stats

 x rm lookup

 x write final stat summary into log

 x ensure good exception handler coverage

 x change timeout queue to a semaphore

doc update and completion

final polish

 x distribution test

 x public posting

bugs
 x set-access command (or rather, re-read of user table) causes exception
