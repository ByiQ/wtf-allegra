    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
      Allegra is an IRC info-bot (an information "robot", or software agent)
      created for the #Ada channel on the Freenode IRC network.  This document
      describes the program itself, including how to build, install, and
      maintain it.  <a href="userman.html">Another document</a> exists
      describing how to use the bot once it is running, and <a
      href="codeman.html">yet another</a> discussing the code itself.
    </p>

    <p>
      Allegra was intended primarily to serve the needs of the #Ada channel,
      and is not presented as a general-purpose info-bot, although her <a
      href="#licensing">code is freely available</a> and may be employed by
      others to whatever extent they find it useful.  For a general-purpose
      IRC bot, try <a href="http://blootbot.sourceforge.net/">blootbot</a>, <a

      others.

    <h2>Licensing</h2>

    <p>
      Allegra's code is covered under the <a
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNAT_Modified_GPL">GNAT Modified
      General Public License</a>.
    </p>


    <!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------ -->
    <a name="requirements">&nbsp;</a>
    <h2>Requirements</h2>

    <p>
      The code for the bot currently running on #Ada was built and runs in the
      following environment:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Kernel: Linux 2.6.32-3-amd64</li>
      <li>Distribution: <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> "squeeze" (testing)</li>
      <li>Compiler: <a href="http://libre.adacore.com/GNAT/">GNAT</a> GPL09 (GNAT GPL 2009 (20090519))</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      It depends on two Ada support libraries:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://coreland.ath.cx/data/code/postgres-ada/">Postgres-Ada</a>,
      a binding to the libpq API library for the PostgreSQL database,
      originally written by Samuel Tardieu, updated and maintained now by
      coreland: current version 0.2.1</li>

      <li><a href="http://www.niestu.com/software/nail-20090205.tar.bz2">NAIL</a>,
      a simple set of Ada utility packages, developed locally: current version
      20090205</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      In turn, Postgres-Ada depends on libpq (currently provided by the Debian
      packages libpq-dev and libpq5, both currently at version 8.4.4-1+b1),
      and once running, the bot expects
      a <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> server to be
      available (package postgresql, current version 8.4.4-1).
    </p>

    <p>
      The code uses some GNAT-specific packages, GNAT.Regpat most heavily, so
      porting it to another Ada compiler would be a bit of work, although the
      GNAT run-time library code is open-source, so in a pinch that could be
      used.
    </p>

    <p>
      We're unaware of any "tight" version requirements, so other versions of
      the above software will likely work.  If you discover any other
      dependencies not listed here, please report them on #Ada.
    </p>

    <a name="buildinst">&nbsp;</a>
    <h2>Building, Installation, and Configuration</h2>

    <a name="building">&nbsp;</a>
    <h3>Building</h3>
    <p>
      Building is quite straightforward (at least on our system!):
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 2em;"><tt>make</tt></p>
    <p>
      If all goes well, this creates the binary, "allegra", which may be
      installed anywhere you wish.  It has no hard-coded dependencies on
      external files; it fetches all of its configuration from the "allegra"
      database on the PostgreSQL server, which is assumed to be running on the
      same host.  To use a server on a different host, the "Host" argument to
      the "Connect" call in config.adb would need to be set to the hostname
      where the server is running.  Possibly, this might be made more
      configurable in a future release, like being taken from a command-line
      option.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some notable aspects of the makefile:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The makefile uses several GNU-make text functions to build lists of
      pathnames and to execute shell functions.  If another make processor is
      used, the makefile will require adaptation to its requirements.  In a
      pinch, you can simply run the gnatprep and gnatmake commands by hand,
      providing the appropriate identity values to gnatprep, and paths for
      AdaSockets and PGAda to gnatmake.</li>

      <li>The PGADA_DIR macro should be set to the pathname where you
      installed the Postgres-Ada package.</li>

      <li>Currently, gnatmake options can be specified via the DEBUG macro,
      eg. "<tt>make&nbsp;DEBUG=-O2</tt>".  Another macro with a more suitable
      name will be added in a future release.</li>

      <li>The program's "identity" text is created each time by the build
      process, then passed to the gnatprep Ada pre-processor to create the
      "identity.adb" package body from the "identity.adp" source.  The VER and
      REV values are set by calling svn, the <a
      href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a> command-line client;
      if you have retrieved the source from its Subversion repository, and
      have svn installed, these commands should work as-is.  If not, you may
      retrieve them from some other source, or simply hard-code them into the
      makefile.</li>
    </ul>

    <a name="installation">&nbsp;</a>
    <h3>Installation</h3>
    <p>
      As mentioned <a href="#building">above</a>, the allegra binary may be
      placed in any location.  It uses a PostgreSQL database for all
      configuration data.  To set up the database, follow these steps:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Once you have the binary built, you need to initialize the database
        used by the bot.  The PostgreSQL utility to create the empty database
        initially is "createdb", and might be used like so:
        <p style="margin-left: 2em;"><tt>createdb allegra "Database for Allegra info-bot"</tt></p>
        If you wish to use a different database name, you will need to change
        the value of the constant "Allegra_DB" in config.ads; again, this is a
        good candidate for a command-line option in future.
      </li>

      <li>
        Once you have created the database, run:
        <p style="margin-left: 2em;"><tt>support/init-config</tt></p>
        from the Allegra install directory, to create the necessary tables and
        populate the configuration tables with their default values.
      </li>

      <li>
        <a name="ranvals">No default values</a> are provided for these tables:
        <ul>
          <li>actquips: Quips that are "actions" (as opposed to normal messages)</li>
          <li>quips: Quips that are normal messages</li>
          <li>quitmsgs: Quit messages</li>
          <li>quotes: Quotes, retrievable via the bot's "quote" command</li>
          <li>usrlevels: Command authorization levels assigned to various usermasks</li>
        </ul>
        You will need to provide your own values for these tables.  One simple
        way to do this is via the PostgreSQL utility "psql", using shell commands
        like so:
        <ul>
          <li><tt>psql -d allegra -c "insert into actquips (msg) values ('runs the 100-metre dash')"</tt></li>
          <li><tt>psql -d allegra -c "insert into quips (msg) values ('I hear you knocking, but you can''t get in!')"</tt></li>
          <li><tt>psql -d allegra -c "insert into quitmsgs (msg) values ('I shall now take my leave.')"</tt></li>
          <li><tt>psql -d allegra -c "insert into quotes (quote,attr) values ('Bah!','Ebenezer Scrooge')"</tt></li>
          <li><tt>psql -d allegra -c "insert into usrlevels values ('nick!user@some.host.net',6)"</tt></li>
        </ul>
        You may insert as many of each sort of message as you wish.  The bot
        will select randomly from among the ones found in the tables.  Adding
        entries to the usrlevels table gives users who match the usermask that
        access level for executing bot commands.  We recommended that you:
        <ol>
          <li>Add your own usermask immediately, with bot operator access (level 10).</li>

          <li>Be careful in giving out bot operator access to anybody else.
          Be sure you trust them implicitly, although most of the damage they
          might do can be corrected by adjusting the database directly using
          psql.  However, without a <a href="#maintenance">backup</a>, you
          can't recover deleted factoids!
          </li>
        </ol>
        
      </li>

      <li>
        The factoid and statistics tables are filled and maintained by the
        bot, either automatically or via bot commands, so no special action
        need be taken for those at installation time.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <a name="configuration">&nbsp;</a>
    <h3>Configuration</h3>
    <p>
      The default configuration values are found in the support/init-config
      script, in the section with the "INSERT INTO config" statements.  The
      current configuration items are:

        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      <a name="chgcfg">You can change the configuration values</a> either by
      editing the support/init-config script before running it, or at any time
      after installation by psql shell commands like these:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><tt>psql -d allegra -c "update config set value='foobar' where name='nickpass'"</tt></li>
      <li><tt>psql -d allegra -c "update config set value=0.1 where name='quips'"</tt></li>
      <li><tt>psql -d allegra -c "update config set value='irc.othernet.org' where name='host'"</tt></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Note that the bot only reads the configuration values at startup, so if
      you change them while it is running, you'll need to stop it (via the
      "quit" bot command) and re-start it.  Hey, we <em>said</em> it wasn't a
      general-purpose bot!
    </p>


    <!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------ -->
    <a name="running">&nbsp;</a>
    <h2>Running</h2>

    <p>
      To use the configured settings for IRC server, port, nickname, channel,
      and logfile pathname, simply run the bot binary with no arguments:
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 2em;"><tt>/path/to/allegra</tt></p>
    <p>
      Normally, we run it backgrounded and nohup'd, like so (under a Bourne-like shell, at least):
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 2em;"><tt>nohup /path/to/allegra >/path/to/startup-errors.log 2>&amp;1 &amp;</tt></p>
    <p>
      The first time or two, check the stderr output (shown above as
      "/path/to/startup-errors.log") to see if any serious errors occurred
      during startup.  After the bot is started, it logs errors in its
      configured log file.
    </p>

    <p>
      To override any of the above-mentioned five configuration values, use
      one or more of these positional command-line parameters:
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 2em;"><tt>allegra <em>irc-host irc-port nick channel logpath</em></tt></p>
    <p>
      Since they are positional, you must specifify them in the order given
      above, and to specify, for example, an alternate IRC channel to join,
      you must also specify the <em>irc-host</em>, <em>irc-port</em>, and
      <em>nick</em> parameters too.  Their meanings:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><em><strong>irc-host</strong></em> -- Network name of the host
      running the IRC server to which you wish to connect,
      eg. "irc.freenode.net"</li>

      <li><em><strong>irc-port</strong></em> -- Numeric port number to use for
      the IRC connection, eg. "9996"</li>

      <li><em><strong>nick</strong></em> -- The IRC nickname the bot should
      use, eg. "Momzer"</li>

      <li><em><strong>channel</strong></em> -- The IRC channel the bot should
      join, without the leading "#", which is added automatically,
      eg. "mychan"</li>

      <li><em><strong>logpath</strong></em> -- Pathname of file to use for log
      messages, eg. "local.log"</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      For testing your own setup and installation of this code, we highly
      recommend <a href="http://pircd.sourceforge.net/">pircd, a Perl IRC
      server</a>.  It's easy to configure and run, and it's what we used when
      developing Allegra.  We run pircd on the development machine, then use
      an allegra command like this, to avoid impacting the one that's running
      live on Freenode:
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 2em;"><tt>./allegra myhost 6667 Allegra testchan local.log &amp;</em></tt></p>
    <p>
      Then we log onto the same server with an IRC client (<a
      href="http://www.xchat.org/">xchat</a> is a good one) and beat hell out
      of, er, <em>test</em> the new bot version from there.
    </p>


    <!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------ -->
    <a name="maintenance">&nbsp;</a>
    <h2>Maintenance</h2>

    <p>
      The bot requires very little upkeep, just a botsnack now and again, and
      careful cultivation of a useful factoid database.  Some maintenance
      tasks to consider:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#ranvals">Adding new values</a> to the random-message tables.</li>

      <li><a href="#chgcfg">Changing values</a> in the configuration.</li>

      <li>Backing up the database.  After the bot has been running for a
      while, the factoid database, user auth table, and command statistics can
      become rather valuable and difficult to recreate.  We recommend that you
      perform regular backups of the database; to that end, we have provided a
      simple shell script, "support/backup", that uses the PostgreSQL shell
      command pg_dump to create a full backup of the current database.  If you
      <a href="#installation">call your database</a> something other than
      "allegra", you will need to change that name on the pg_dump command in
      that script.  It puts the backup in a file named
      "db-backup.<em>YYYY-MM-DD</em>", where "<em>YYYY-MM-DD</em>" is the date
      you ran the script.</li>

      <li>Her log file will grow endlessly, and while she doesn't log too much
      when the default "err" log level is set, it can grow quite quickly if
      you set "dbg" and run on a busy channel.  Consider using something like
      <a href="http://iain.cx/src/logrotate/">the logrotate utility</a> to
      automatically archive the log file.</li>
    </ul>
